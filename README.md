# Starbucks Capstone Project

The project for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. 

# Overview
This project contains simulated data that mimics customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks.

Instead of randomly sending offers to customers, a business can use a more targeted approach and distribute promotions to a more responsive group.

Each customer can be given a recommendation, based on their demographic information and based on collected data of previous transactions form similar customers.
